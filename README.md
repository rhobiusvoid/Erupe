# Erupe Community Reupload
 This is a community upload of a community project. The amount of people who worked on it is innumerous, and hard to keep track of. But id like to contribute this to the efforts of Ando, Fists Team, the French Team, Mai's Team and the many wondeful members of the MHFZ community who gave their time and energy to help us. No matter the relations, these files will remain public and open source, free for all to use and modify. 


A pastebin for general overview, tips, and FAQ: https://pastebin.com/QqAwZSTC

An upload for the quest and scenario files will be here: https://github.com/xl3lackout/MHFZ-Quest-Files
(itll take a while its like 300k+ files)

Client Files (Game Files) if you need them:

Quoted From the pastebin:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GUIDES!]
[ACTUAL INSTALLATION GUIDES, THESE GUIDES ASSUME YOU HAVE WINDOWS 10!]
 
Download links for an all-in-one package that contains the Server and Client files.
Instructions on how to set up both the client and the server are also included in these downloads.
 
1fichier: https://1fichier.com/?t458z9n40a3he0nhe7q5
1fichier is very fast and doesn't have a quota, but if your download fails you have to wait two hours. Rather spartan.
 
Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18C6Wzz2oCAv-rc05HLjsEdeGMiPgV9r-/view?usp=sharing
Google Drive is reliable, but there's sometimes an inexplicable quota when too many people download it. Honestly your best choice for pretty much anything since you can also make a copy of the files to your own Drive.
 
In case you're not a fan of text guides...

Here's a video created by a friend of mine (SephVII), which walks you through how to setup everything. 
 
If it says you can't download the file, follow this image guide.

If it somehow doesn't work, either wait a bit for Drive to start working again, or use the 1fichier link, as it will always be available. Yes, I'm also mad that Google Drive removed the old way of doing the quota bypass.

Special thanks to Hiroaki for the Quest Clear timer.
